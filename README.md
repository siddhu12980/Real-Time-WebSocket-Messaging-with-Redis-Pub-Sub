### Project Structure

Here's a basic structure for your project:

```
/chat-room-app
│
├── /server
│   ├── index.ts         # Main entry point for the server
│   ├── wsHandler.ts     # WebSocket handling logic
│   ├── pubsubHandler.ts # Redis Pub/Sub logic
│   └── roomManager.ts   # Room management (create/join room)
│
├── /client
│   ├── index.html       # Frontend for connecting to chat rooms
│   ├── app.js           # Frontend WebSocket client logic
│
├── /types               # TypeScript types (optional)
│
└── package.json
```

### Key Components

1. **Room Management**:
   - Users can create or join rooms.
   - A room is uniquely identified by an ID or a code.
   - When users create a room, it generates an ID and stores information like room members.

2. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - When a user joins a room, a WebSocket connection is established with the server.
   - This connection will handle sending and receiving messages.

3. **Redis Pub/Sub**:
   - Each chat room is a separate Redis Pub/Sub channel.
   - When a user sends a message, it is **published** to the Redis channel associated with the room.
   - All WebSocket connections subscribed to that room (channel) receive the message via Redis **subscription**.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### 1. **Room Management**
   - Define endpoints to handle the creation and joining of chat rooms:
     - `/create-room`: Generates a unique room ID.
     - `/join-room/:roomId`: Joins a user to the specified room.
   - Store room details (like connected users) in memory or Redis.

#### 2. **WebSocket Server**
   - Set up a WebSocket server that listens for connections.
   - When a user joins a room:
     - Establish a WebSocket connection.
     - Subscribe to the Redis channel associated with the room.
     - Notify other users in the room of the new participant.
   - When a message is received:
     - Publish the message to the room’s Redis channel.

#### 3. **Redis Pub/Sub for Rooms**
   - Each room will have its own Redis channel.
   - When a user sends a message to the room, it is **published** to the corresponding Redis channel.
   - All WebSocket clients in that room (subscribed to the Redis channel) will receive the message in real-time.

#### 4. **Frontend WebSocket Client**
   - Create a simple frontend that connects to the WebSocket server.
   - After joining a room, the WebSocket client sends messages and listens for incoming messages.
   - Display messages in a chat interface.

### Flow of Events

1. **Creating or Joining a Room**:
   - User A opens the client and chooses to create a new room.
   - Server generates a unique room ID (e.g., `room123`).
   - User A shares this room ID with User B.
   - User B joins `room123` using the unique code.

2. **WebSocket Connections**:
   - Both User A and User B establish WebSocket connections to the server.
   - The server subscribes each WebSocket to the Redis channel for `room123`.

3. **Message Flow**:
   - User A sends a message (e.g., "Hello!") via WebSocket to the server.
   - The server **publishes** the message to the Redis channel for `room123`.
   - Redis **notifies** all subscribers (User A and User B) with the message.
   - The server forwards the message to all WebSocket connections in `room123`, and both User A and User B see the message in real-time.

### Considerations

- **Scaling**: If you want to scale horizontally, Redis Pub/Sub can manage communication across different instances of your WebSocket server. No need to worry about distributing connections since Redis handles it.
  
- **Persisting Messages**: If you want chat messages to persist (so users can see the chat history when they join a room), you could store them in a Redis list or a database like MongoDB.
  
- **Authentication**: If needed, implement user authentication before allowing them to create or join rooms.

### Checklist for Implementation

1. **Setup Redis and WebSocket Server**:
   - Install Redis and WebSocket packages (`ioredis`, `ws` for Node.js).
   - Set up Redis client and WebSocket server.

2. **Create Room Logic**:
   - Create a unique room ID and subscribe the server to that room's Redis channel.

3. **Handle WebSocket Events**:
   - When a user connects to a room, subscribe them to the Redis channel.
   - Listen for messages on the WebSocket connection.
   - When a message is received, publish it to Redis.

4. **Frontend WebSocket Client**:
   - Implement WebSocket client logic that connects, sends messages, and listens for updates.

5. **Test the Flow**:
   - Start two or more clients, join the same room, and test real-time messaging.

### Technologies

- **Node.js + Express**: Backend to handle room creation/joining.
- **Redis (Pub/Sub)**: Handle message broadcasting within rooms.
- **WebSocket (ws)**: Real-time communication between server and clients.
- **Frontend (HTML/JS)**: Simple UI for the chat interface.

With this structure, you can now build and learn Redis Pub/Sub alongside WebSockets. You’ll gain experience with real-time messaging, distributed systems, and handling chatroom-like features!
